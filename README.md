#  AI Workshop Creating a Character with AI
Documentation mokerslag workshop

#  Why
We chose AI because it is a technology that is increasingly influencing our daily lives - often without us realizing it. With the workshop we want to show what AI is, how it works, and what you can (and cannot) do with it. By working with it themselves in the workshop, participants can better understand what AI means for them, now and in the future.

namely:

- How to write good prompts in chatgpt so that the output is clarified
- Elevenlabs to generate speech with an AI
- Adobe Firefly to generate images with ai

#  How long
The workshop takes about a 1.5 hours
